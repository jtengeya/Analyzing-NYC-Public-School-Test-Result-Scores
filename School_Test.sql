-- THe project is about Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores from New York City's public schools.
-- The dataset included the average SAT scores for math, reading, and writing, along with the school name, borough, and building code. 
-- The goal was understand the performance of these schools in different aspects of the SAT.

-- How many schools fail to report information
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_schools_missing_info

WHERE average_math IS NULL OR average_reading IS NULL OR average_writing IS NULL OR percent_tested IS NULL;
-- 20 schools failed to report their information  and this might be due to lack of participation or administrative errors 

-- Which (or how many) schools are best/worst in each of the three components of the SATâ€”reading, math, and writing
--  best
