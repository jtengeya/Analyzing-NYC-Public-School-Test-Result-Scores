# Analyzing-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
Understanding the performance of schools in different aspects of the SAT in NYC boroughs using SQL
## Project Overview
In this project, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores from New York City's public schools was analyzed. The dataset included the average SAT scores for math, reading, and writing, along with the school name, borough, and building code. The goal was to understand the performance of these schools in different aspects of the SAT.

## Key Findings
1. **Reporting of Information**: It was found that some schools failed to report their average scores for math, reading, or writing. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of participation or administrative errors.
2. **Best/Worst Schools in Each Component**: Schools with the highest and lowest average scores in each of the three components of the SATâ€”math, reading, and writing was identified. 
3. **Top Schools by Total SAT Scores**: The top 10 schools by total SAT scores was listed. These schools have demonstrated overall excellence in all three components of the SAT.
4. **Test Performance by Borough**: How the test performance varies by borough was analyzed. 
5. **Top Schools in a Selected Borough**: Top 5 schools by average SAT scores across all three components in a selected borough was identified. 

## Conclusion
The analysis of the SAT scores from New York City's public schools provided valuable insights into the performance of these schools. However, it is important to note that test scores are just one aspect of a school's performance and should be considered along with other factors such as the school environment, teacher quality, and extracurricular opportunities.
